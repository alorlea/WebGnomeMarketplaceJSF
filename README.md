WebGnomeMarketplaceJSF
======================

This is the code for a web based marketplace in JSF for a shop handling plastic gnomes. User can register, update the cart and admins can add and delete new types of gnomes. The web design is very simple and the application was done following the MVC pattern. We put into practice all the things we learned in the course (JPA, JSF, java entities). This work was done by me and my colleague for the course in KTH.
